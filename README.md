# COVID 19 Classification on Chatbot questions and answers (QAs)

## Methodology
Here is the code that combines data from ChatBot QAs and COVID QAs and provides classification based on the questions asked by the user. Words data are then encoded by TF-IDF and we run 3 prediction algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Stochastic Gradient Descent) to provide which model are most efficient to implement on a real-time Google BigQuery system.
